Dear Professor,



Greetings yet again from the SIGGRAPH 2007
<http://siggraph.org/s2007>Student Volunteers Committee! Our
application deadline is only a few days
away and we wanted to get one more reminder out to you and your students
about the great opportunity SIGGRAPH offers students. If you would, please
pass this information on to your students and fellow faculty to help us
spread the word. There are many exciting things on the horizon for this
year's Student Volunteers, and we invite your students to apply to join our
team at sv.siggraph.org!



A special interest group under the Association for Computing Machinery
focused on computer graphics and interactive techniques, the SIGGRAPH team
is preparing for the 34th annual conference in San Diego, CA August 5-9,
2007. Student Volunteers are an integral part of the conference, providing
needed assistance to conference attendees and participants in exchange for
entrance to the conference and, in some cases, hotel accommodations and
travel grants.


Some of the benefits Student Volunteers may receive:

   - Full conference access
   - Travel and housing assistance possibilities
   - Special sessions featuring industry professionals
   - Career mentoring opportunities
   - Resume and demo reel review opportunities
   - Behind-the-scenes knowledge of conference happenings
   - Networking opportunities with current and future industry leaders
   - Advice from Student Volunteer Alumni

Student Volunteers work either 30 or 18 hours throughout the conference
week, engaging in a variety of tasks such as door and session monitoring,
attendee registration, and exhibit demonstration in venues such as Emerging
Technologies and the Guerrilla Studio.



We welcome you to visit our website at sv.siggraph.org. The
FAQs<http://www.siggraph.org/s2007/volunteers/students/faqs.html>and
Qualifications<http://www.siggraph.org/s2007/volunteers/students/qualifications.html>pages
offer additional information.  You may also contact us at
sv2007@siggraph.org <MikkiFlower@siggraph.org> if you or your students have
any additional questions that are not found in the FAQs. The online
application <http://www.siggraph.org/s2007/presenters/forms/index.html> will
be open until the deadline at 11:59 pm PT, February 25, 2007.


Attached are a few promotional items that we have made to help tell students
about our program. Please feel free to forward this e-mail and use the
attached materials if you would like. We hope that you will encourage your
students to apply!


Thank you for your time and support!



Sincerely,

Mikki Flower
